# myblog
A simple yet custom built blog engine for my upcoming blog using PHP and MySQL.

The project contains:
1. A custom built CMS to handle features like Create/Read/Update/Delete for:
- > Blog posts
- > Categories
- > Personal links
- > Images
- > Subscribers
- > Users (Admin only for now)
- > Messages/Feedback (This will contain a mailing system)
- > Images (Upload and Download images)
- > Comments (This will contain a simple commenting system)

2. Main blog page to display all archives, categories, posts and comments.
